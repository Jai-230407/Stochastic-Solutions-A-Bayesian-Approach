# Stochastic-Solutions-A-Bayesian-Approach
# Theory Behind: Stochastic Solutions ‚Äì A Bayesian Approach
This project applies Bayesian inference to estimate unknown parameters in stochastic models, which are models influenced by randomness (e.g., diffusion processes, chemical reactions, or financial systems).

# üß† Core Concepts:
Stochastic Modeling: Represents systems where outcomes are probabilistic (e.g., modeled using differential equations with noise).

Bayesian Inference: Incorporates prior knowledge and observed data to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters.

Monte Carlo Methods: Simulate random samples to approximate solutions for complex distributions.

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Specifically, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to sample from the posterior when it's analytically intractable.

# üìå Workflow:
Define Prior Beliefs about parameters (e.g., normal, uniform).

Model the Likelihood using the stochastic process and observed data.

Compute Posterior via Bayes‚Äô Theorem:

# P(Œ∏‚à£D)‚àùP(D‚à£Œ∏)‚ãÖP(Œ∏)
# Run MCMC Simulations (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings) to sample from the posterior.

Analyze Posterior Samples for parameter estimates and uncertainty quantification.

‚úÖ Why It Matters:
Quantifies uncertainty in parameters using full probability distributions.

Robust to noisy or incomplete data.

# Ideal for real-world applications where deterministic modeling falls short.
