# Stochastic-Solutions-A-Bayesian-Approach
# Theory Behind: Stochastic Solutions ‚Äì A Bayesian Approach
This project applies Bayesian inference to estimate unknown parameters in stochastic models, which are models influenced by randomness (e.g., diffusion processes, chemical reactions, or financial systems).

# üß† Core Concepts:
Stochastic Modeling: Represents systems where outcomes are probabilistic (e.g., modeled using differential equations with noise).

Bayesian Inference: Incorporates prior knowledge and observed data to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters.

Monte Carlo Methods: Simulate random samples to approximate solutions for complex distributions.

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Specifically, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to sample from the posterior when it's analytically intractable.

# üìå Workflow:
Define Prior Beliefs about parameters (e.g., normal, uniform).

Model the Likelihood using the stochastic process and observed data.

Compute Posterior via Bayes‚Äô Theorem:

# P(Œ∏‚à£D)‚àùP(D‚à£Œ∏)‚ãÖP(Œ∏)
# Run MCMC Simulations (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings) to sample from the posterior.

Analyze Posterior Samples for parameter estimates and uncertainty quantification.

‚úÖ Why It Matters:
Quantifies uncertainty in parameters using full probability distributions.

Robust to noisy or incomplete data.

# Ideal for real-world applications where deterministic modeling falls short.

 # Theory: Ternary Distillation
üîç Introduction
Ternary distillation refers to the separation of a liquid mixture containing three components (A, B, and C) into individual or partially purified fractions using thermal energy and mass transfer. It is a natural extension of binary distillation but introduces significant complexity due to interactions among the three components.

# ‚öóÔ∏è Basic Principles
Distillation exploits differences in volatility (i.e., tendency to vaporize) of components. The more volatile components tend to rise in the distillation column, while the less volatile ones accumulate toward the bottom.

# In a ternary system:

One component is the most volatile (light key),

One is the least volatile (heavy key),

The third behaves intermediately and may act as a distribution agent.

Unlike binary systems (which can be plotted on a simple y‚Äìx diagram), ternary mixtures often require triangular phase diagrams or rigorous simulations to analyze.

üß† Key Concepts
1. Relative Volatility
The ratio of volatilities between any two components, usually expressed as:

ùõºij = Ki/Kj
 Ki is the vapor-liquid equilibrium ratio for component. It governs how easily components can be separated.

2. Design Considerations
Ternary distillation design involves:

Feed composition

Number of theoretical stages

Reflux ratio

Column configuration (e.g., sequence in multicolumn setups)

Tray or packing efficiency

3. Azeotropes
Some ternary systems form azeotropes‚Äîmixtures that boil at constant temperature and composition‚Äîmaking separation more complex or even impossible without special techniques like pressure-swing or extractive distillation.

# üîÅ Modeling Ternary Distillation
For simulation or design purposes, the separation process is modeled using:

Mass balance equations

Equilibrium stage modeling (e.g., McCabe-Thiele for simple cases)

Stage efficiency to account for non-ideal performance

Energy balance, especially when heat integration is involved

In computational simulations (like yours), simplified or empirical relationships are often used to represent purity as a function of reflux ratio, feed splits, and efficiency under uncertainty.

# üß™ Use in Stochastic Modeling
Because real-world distillation systems are subject to fluctuations (e.g., feed quality, temperature, efficiency), it is valuable to treat key inputs as random variables and use Monte Carlo or Bayesian methods to:

Analyze uncertainty in purity

Quantify risk in design or operation

Perform robust optimization
